# When I Work Mini API

A small API similar in structure to the When I Work API.

## Installation

`git clone git@github.com:philgran/wiw-api.git && cd wiw-api && npm install && npm start`

This application uses a PostgreSQL. If you want to run it locally, you will need to create a database called `wiwapi`. Change the values in the sample.env accordingly, and rename that file to `.env`.

## Usage

Fire up the Postman application and import the included wiw-api.postman_collection.json file. This will have example queries for all the services which you can edit and send.
